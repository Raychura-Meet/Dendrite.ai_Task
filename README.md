Task Overview:

The task involves writing a Python script to parse a provided JSON file (algoparams_from_ui) and sequentially execute a series of machine learning steps. The script should be generic enough to handle any JSON following the given format. The main steps include reading the target and regression type, handling missing data, performing feature reduction, creating and training model objects using sklearn, and executing hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. The code should log standard model metrics to the console and be capable of rerunning with different JSON configurations by modifying specific fields. The use of sklearn pipelines is recommended for efficiency in executing the feature handling, feature reduction, and model fitting stages.
